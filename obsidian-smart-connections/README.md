> [!QUESTION] **Is this you?**
> You're an Obsidian power‑user, researcher, writer, or lifelong learner with **hundreds or thousands of notes**. You capture ideas quickly, but later struggle to find and connect them when it matters most.


> [!WARNING] **The Problem**
> Valuable insights disappear in a sea of unlinked notes, forcing endless scrolling, re‑reading, and duplicated work. Time you wanted for creativity leaks away into manual organization.

## Private by Design, Privacy by Default
User-aligned means privacy, local-first decisions, are by design and implemented by default. Privacy shouldn't be an opt-in only or premium feature. Smart Connections default settings are designed to work with zero setup, using a local AI embedding model that works offline.

## Built for You

> [!NOTE] Smart Connections changed my life
> Smart Connections started as a personal tool, like many others I built before it. But, this time was different.
> 
> This time, the Obsidian community became a part of the process. From the beginning, Smart Connections users empowered me to realize the potential of user-aligned tools for thought. 
> 
> The earliest adopters, like Sarah, gave me critical feedback that improved the software and provided financial support that enabled me to focus on the project full-time. 
> 
> Matthew joined the community and started our Community Lean Coffee meetings, which have become an invaluable resource and introduced me to many more people that have given their time and resources to support my work.
> 
> This experience made me realize how we can work together to empower each other with new ideas and user-aligned tools to thrive with AI.
> 
> Smart Connections helped me realize my core-value & purpose of empowerment. It empowered me to make the connection of synergy between my love for building and empowering ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results.

### It's not about features, it's about empowerment
I build tools that empower you (me) to bring your (my) ideas to reality. 

### Built from scratch
Building the Smart Environment, the core architecture behind Smart Connections, from scratch has empowered me with a deep understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI. These insights are why I believe the Smart Ecosystem will outlast me.

### Stronger together
Smart Connections represents a threat to profit-driven enterprises that benefit from powerless individuals. User-aligned software means leveraging efficiencies that are out-of-reach for major corporations. I hope my journey inspires you to break-free from the belief that you are limited and that others are in control.

### Come for the tools, stay for the community
Smart Connections users come for the tools, but they stay for the mission-driven community and our shared vision of empowering ourselves with Smart Tools and Workflows. Together, we are on a journey of exploration and empowerment!

## Smart Ecosystem
As luck has it, I began jotting down lines of code for automations in my school notebooks. This grew into a skill for designing complex systems.

### Smart Plugins
I build Smart Plugins, like Smart Connections, to empower myself to explore new concepts, design better tools, and handle more complexity in my Obsidian. My goal is to make as many of these concepts and tools available to you.

### Smart Business Model
The reality is that most valuable tools cannot exist without financial support. But that doesn't mean having to sell-out or shutdown. Obsidian has shown us that valuable software can be user-funded, and I believe now is a better time than ever to bring the vision of user-aligned software to reality.
#### Principle: Build local tools to maximize empowerment
Software that runs locally can empower unlimited users with zero-marginal cost. 
#### Principle: User-supported means user-aligned
Early & experimental features are provided to supporters. This means more-reliable software with a valuable feedback loop from users invested in making the project better.

## FAQs & Troubleshooting
### Syncthing (third-party syncing)
*Official services, like Obsidian Sync, help keep Obsidian user-aligned. Smart Connections has built-in compatibility with Obsidian Sync.*
However, if you must use a third-party sync service, be sure to **add the `.smart-env/` directory to "ignore patterns"** to prevent issues.

### Windows dedicated GPU
If embeddings default to the integrated GPU, set `ollama.exe` to **High performance** in your GPU control panel.
See [issue #1028](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues/1028#issuecomment-3070187288) for context.
